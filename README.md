# Project Archived

Please note, this project has been archived because Inferno now uses an
alternate method for creating and distributing testing modules.  Please visit
https://inferno.healthit.gov for more information.

# Inferno Example Starter Application

This is an example of how to use inferno as a library to create custom testing modules.

To experiment with this code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Usage

The `inferno` gem is included in this repository as it is not yet published on rubygems.org.  To install the gem locally run:

`gem install ./inferno-2.8.0.gem`

Then run

`bundle install --local`

The application can then be started with:

`bundle exec rackup`
